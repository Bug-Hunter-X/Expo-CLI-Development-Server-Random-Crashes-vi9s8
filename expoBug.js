While using Expo CLI, I encountered an issue where the development server would randomly crash without providing any clear error messages in the terminal.  The app would continue to run on the device or simulator, but any changes made to the code would not reflect in the live reload. This occurred intermittently and seemingly without any discernible pattern. I've tried restarting the computer, clearing the cache, and reinstalling Expo CLI, but the problem persists.
